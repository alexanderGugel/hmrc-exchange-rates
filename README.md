# `hmrc-exchange-rates`

HMRC publishes monthly exchange rates in XML format [[Source](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/softwaredevelopers/2023-exrates.html)]. Unfortunately, the format in which those exchange rates are published are rather unwieldy.

`hmrc-exchange-rates` downloads exchange rates from HMRC and produces a simple CSV file, containing monthly exchange rates for all major currencies between February 2015 and the most recent month for which HMRC has published rates.

## Usage

Run `make all`, which will
1. build the binary,
2. download monthly exchange rates between February 2015 and the most recent month for which HMRC has published rates,
3. generate `hmrc_exchange_rates.csv`, `hmrc_exchange_rates_usd.csv`, and `hmrc_exchange_rates_eur.csv`.

- `hmrc_exchange_rates.csv` contains monthly exchange rates for **all** major currencies.
- `hmrc_exchange_rates_{usd,eur}.csv` are filtered versions of `hmrc_exchange_rates.csv`, only containing USD / EUR exchange rates respectively.

The program requires a somewhat recent version of Go. I've tested things with go1.19.2, but older versions should work as well.
